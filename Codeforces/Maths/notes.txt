For printing val1+val2, its always better to break the expression into different parts and then print it. 
Printing it directly is gives WA for huge numbers
int val1 = ((m-1)/2) * n;
int val2 = ceil(n/(2*1.0));
cout<<val1+val2<<endl;

Instead of printing the expression directly, first capture the value in a variable and then print it.. Gives WA for large values of n
int val = ceil(n/(2*1.0));
cout<<val<<endl;
cout<<ceil(n/(2*1.0));;

10%4 = 2
13%9 = 4 ,5
100%13 = 9, 4
12%5 = 2, 3
